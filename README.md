URL Shortener using Typescript, NodeJS, Express,Redis, MongoDB Cluster, Mongoose and Heroku.

Demo here!
https://flores-url-shorty.herokuapp.com/

I choose mongodb because its easy to get a cluster up and running thanks to atlas but any other db could work.
Helmet middleware is used to provide fast and reliable security to a express application, might add other modules such as rate-limiter-flexible to improve security against ddos
Express is lightweight and very known, nevertheless hapi was also considered. Might try to replicate this project with nestjs.

If you found this repository for some reason and want to replicate for get some practice with node, these diagrams might help you if you are stuck.
